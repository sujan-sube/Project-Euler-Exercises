# Project-Euler-Exercises

I recently found out about [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). The website provides a large set of problems that challenge mathematical and coding skills. I'll be working on them overtime (using Python3) and pushing my solutions to this repository. If you would like to see the answers, run `ProjectEulerSelect.py` then enter the Problem ID in the prompt.
