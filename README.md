# Project-Euler-Exercises

I recently learned about [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and their series of challenges in mathematics and computing. The website provides a wide variety of problems that challenge mathematical and programming skills. I'll be working on them overtime (using Python3) and pushing my solutions to this repository. If you would like to see the answers, run `ProjectEulerSelect.py` then enter the Problem ID in the prompt.
